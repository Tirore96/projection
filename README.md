This repository is the Coq mechanisation that accompanies the paper "Sound and Complete Projection of Multi Party Session Types".

The mapping between the paper to the code is:

Section 2 (Global Types, Local Types, and Standard Projection) -> IndTypes/\
Section 3 (Projection on Coinductive Types) -> CoTypes/\
Section 4 (Projection on Inductive Types: Soundness and Completeness) -> Projection/IndProj.v\
Section 5 (Deciding Projectability) -> Projection/Intermediateproj.v, Projection/ProjectDecide.v
